\f0\fs24 \cf0 One issue I can describe was with the textview in which it wasn\'92t scrolling because touching it trigger the list-view scroll. This issue could be fixed but didn\'92t have enough time to finish it so I made the height of the description textview adjusted to size that fits.\

The app could be made better with animation indicating progress and better fonts. }
